/**
 * This function allows you to read the status of one of TIC's buttons. It returns true only if the key has been pressed since the last frame.
 * You can also use the optional hold and period parameters which allow you to check if a button is being held down. After the time specified by hold has elapsed, btnp will return true each time period is passed if the key is still down. For example, to re-examine the state of button '0' after 2 seconds and continue to check its state every 1/10th of a second, you would use btnp(0, 120, 6). Since time is expressed in ticks and TIC runs at 60 frames per second, we use the value of 120 to wait 2 seconds and 6 ticks (ie 60/10) as the interval for re-checking.
 * @param id The id of the key we wish to interrogate - see the key map for reference
